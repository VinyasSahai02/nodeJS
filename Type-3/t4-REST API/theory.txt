RESTFULL API
these are some rules/best practices that we follow
only then we can say that our server is built on rest API

1. ALWAYS FOLLOW SERVER CLIENT ARCHITECTURE
-- sever ek alg cheez hai aur client ek alag cheez
when a servcer sends a res, it can be a text, image, htmldoc, json
if the res is html(SSR) and the client is browser then it will simply render it
but if the client is something like alexa then we cannot render html
so we can say thet the client is dependent on the server which should not happen in restapi

if the res is JSON or raw format, client can independently process this data and render it accordingly

if we know that our client is browser then always send html
but is we have moblie app, iot, smat devices then send raw data

2. ALWAYS RESPECT ALL HTTP METHODS
use http method appropriately
like dont use post method to delete, use delete method

note-
to handle json and htlm in express change res.send() to res.json(json object)
